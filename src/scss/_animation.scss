    if they change the website i have an screenshot in the images,

    *****************
    So i tested the behavior when having 8 images instead of 5, with the settings of 5, catastrophe! doing that will create two rows of images, so i had to change the width here, 100 pictures divided by 8 pictures = 12,5, here you have to add 12.5, no comas! but i like the 12 alone, then i went up and i changed the width inside the #slider figure, from 300% to 500%.
